        About this site
        <br />
        This is a simple Hacker News clone, built with SvelteKit, an application
        framework for Svelte.
        <br />
        <br />
        Svelte is a new kind of framework, one that compiles your component
        templates into fast, compact JavaScript â€” either client-side or
        server-side. You can read more about the design and philosophy in the
        introductory blog post.

        We're using hnpwa-api as a backend. The app is hosted on Vercel.
